# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Luke Fiji

Chapter two explains how the English language is full of clutter. The author serves several examples of how clutter is commonly used in English such as using the word "personal" in "a personal friend of mine." He also explains how governments and corporations use euphemisms to make tragedies seem like petty problems. He then suggests ways to recognize clutter by noting components that weren't doing useful work in the writing. In the third chapter, style, the author explains how clutter is used to make statements vague and ambiguous. Writing, in general, should be concise.
